# Mining Mania
## WARN
- Working on updating the readme just to show what the project actually looked like. 
- I may at some point try and bring this as a deliverable package but I doubt I will have the time to do that.
- (nor was it a good enough game to probably be worth doing that).

## Summary
This is Mining Mania developed by Liam Harvell, Henrique Lacerda Delgado De Sa, Lucas Favarao, Xing Xu. It is a physics based movement, twin stick shooter.
This project was meant to understand the process of creating a product from start to finish.

## Gameplay 

Other mechanics I have recordings of will go here, but I will need to do some video editing for use on github.
